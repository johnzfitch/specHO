The old house stood at the end of the street, its weathered facade telling stories of decades past. Children would often dare each other to approach the creaky front gate, though none ever ventured further. Local legends spoke of strange lights in the windows late at night, but most residents dismissed these tales as mere superstition.

Despite its reputation, the house had been home to the Henderson family for three generations. Mrs. Henderson still tended her rose garden every morning, completely unfazed by the neighborhood gossip. Her grandson visited on weekends, bringing fresh bread from the bakery downtown. They would sit on the porch together, watching the world go by, sharing comfortable silence broken only by occasional observations about passing neighbors or changing seasons.
