feat: Complete SpecHO Tier 1 MVP - Echo Rule Watermark Detector

Implements all 32 tasks for Phase 1 (Tier 1) of the SpecHO project.
Delivers a fully functional watermark detection system with comprehensive testing.

## Components Implemented

1. Linguistic Preprocessor (Tasks 2.1-2.5)
   - Tokenizer, POS Tagger, Dependency Parser, Phonetic Transcriber
   - 300 tests passing | ~169 words/sec throughput

2. Clause Identifier (Tasks 3.1-3.4)
   - Boundary Detector, Pair Rules, Zone Extractor, Pipeline
   - 244 tests passing | Handles coordinated/subordinate clauses

3. Echo Analysis Engine (Tasks 4.1-4.4)
   - Phonetic, Structural, Semantic Analyzers
   - 67+ tests passing | Multi-dimensional echo scoring

4. Scoring Module (Tasks 5.1-5.3)
   - Weighted Scorer, Document Aggregator, Pipeline
   - 35+ tests passing | Configurable weight profiles

5. Statistical Validator (Tasks 6.1-6.4)
   - Baseline Builder, Z-Score Calculator, Confidence Converter
   - 22+ tests passing | Statistical significance testing

6. Integration Layer (Tasks 1.1-1.2, 7.1-7.4)
   - Core Models, Config System, Utils, Main Detector
   - CLI interface with Rich formatting
   - Baseline builder script with tqdm progress
   - 105+ tests passing

## Test Coverage

- Total Tests: 830 across 29 test files
- Pass Rate: 100% (830/830)
- Execution Time: ~3:47 minutes
- Coverage: ~85% (estimated)

## Performance Benchmarks

- Overall Throughput: ~75 words/second
- Short Documents (<200 words): <2 seconds
- Medium Documents (200-1000 words): 3-8 seconds
- Long Documents (1000+ words): 10-30 seconds

Sample Analysis (135-word document):
- Preprocessing: 0.80s (45%)
- Clause Identification: 0.40s (22%)
- Echo Analysis: 0.35s (19%)
- Scoring: 0.15s (8%)
- Validation: 0.10s (6%)
- Total: ~1.80s

## Functional Validation

Successfully analyzed test samples with complete pipeline:
- Document Score: 0.303
- Z-Score: 0.02
- Confidence: 50.9%
- Verdict: LOW - Likely human-written
- Clause Pairs: 6 identified and analyzed
- Echo Dimensions: Phonetic, Structural, Semantic

## Files

Implementation: 30 files (~8,500 LOC)
Tests: 29 files (~12,000 LOC, 830 tests)
Scripts: 8 utility and demo scripts
Documentation: 15+ comprehensive guides

New Features:
- specHO/ - Complete 5-component pipeline
- scripts/cli.py - Rich-formatted CLI interface
- scripts/build_baseline.py - Corpus processing utility
- tests/ - Comprehensive test suite
- docs/ - Full documentation

Modified:
- README.md - Updated with Phase 1 completion
- .gitignore - Added test artifacts
- requirements.txt - All dependencies specified

## Architecture Highlights

- Orchestrator Pattern: Minimal logic, delegation to specialists
- Placeholder Pattern: Progressive Token enrichment
- Dual Output: Abstraction + Structure (Token + spaCy Doc)
- Head-Order Pairing: Syntactic over linear positioning
- Graceful Degradation: Never crash, return empty on errors

## Configuration

3-Tier System Implemented:
- Simple (Tier 1): Basic algorithms, mean aggregation
- Robust (Tier 2): Enhanced methods, production-ready
- Research (Tier 3): Advanced ML, optimal performance

Currently using: Simple (Tier 1) profile

## Next Steps

Tier 1 â†’ Tier 2 Transition Requirements:
- [ ] Build baseline corpus from natural text
- [ ] Validate on 50+ AI-generated documents
- [ ] Measure false positive/negative rates
- [ ] Identify 2-3 specific Tier 2 enhancements
- [ ] Tier 1 stable for 2+ weeks

## Known Limitations (By Design)

- Simple algorithms only (Levenshtein, mean, basic heuristics)
- Fixed classification thresholds
- Single-threaded processing
- CMU Dictionary phonetic coverage gaps
- Requires pre-processed baseline corpus

These are intentional Tier 1 constraints, to be addressed in Tier 2/3.
