# Shepherd the Future, Don’t Just Invite It

## 🧠 How Digg Can Resist AI Decay and Stay Human

Hey Digg,

With user invites coming this week, I’ve seen a lot of great posts questioning what makes this place special. It’s prompted me to share how I've been thinking about that question, because I believe the answer is directly tied to the future we're hoping to build.

To me, Digg isn't just another platform, it's our rare chance to avoid the pitfalls that nearly every other online community has stumbled into. We’re on the threshold of becoming either another footnote or a lasting, human-centric community. This is our calm before the new-user storm, and we need to be clear-eyed and focused about how we distribute access to this place.

## 🌐 The New Gold Rush: Unmanipulated Human Data

First, let’s get on the same page about a critical reality: we don’t want bots here. Not just because they spam, but because of something far more consequential… data scraping.

We are living through a seismic shift. The rarest, most valuable resource for AI development won’t be silicon chips or electricity; it will be unmanipulated, organic, human thoughts and conversations. Tech giants are already running out of real, untouched-by-machine, text.

Recent studies, like the teacher-student experiments from UC Berkeley and other AI-safety researchers, reveal a deeply troubling phenomenon called “model collapse.” When large language models are trained on too much synthetic data (text created by other AIs), they begin to degrade. They become what researchers call misaligned, lose their grip on reality, often fall into repetitive loops, generate "evil" responses to prompts, and can even develop strange, insular dialects that only they and copies of themselves can understand.

This isn’t hypothetical, it’s already happening.

To stay functional, these models need a constant IV drip of fresh, authentic human thought. And they’re already running out. Digg is currently a small oasis of authentic human conversation. But if we’re not careful, this priceless resource will be harvested, sold, and diluted by machines until it collapses into the same meaningless sludge as the rest of the web already has.

## 🧠 Why the Old Startup Playbook Will Fail Us

I see a lot of talk here on Digg assuming the only path forward is the one every startup has taken for the last fifteen years: open the floodgates, chase exponential growth, burn cash, then slap on an ad platform, pay-for-access subscriptions, and/or a pay-for-API strategy.

But Digg’s current success lies in its human scale.

We don’t need millions of users overnight. We need careful, sustainable growth built on thoughtful curation. AI assistance for writing a post is one thing; wholesale scraping and synthetic saturation is another. This community and our shared thoughts can't become another place online that gets hoovered up and repackaged by a chatbot.

## 🔑 Our Invites: The Keys to the Kingdom

Soon, we’ll each get two invite codes. These aren’t casual links to be dropped into a Reddit thread for karma. They are keys to this community.

Additionally, invites aren’t about deciding who’s “worthy” to join Digg. They’re about protecting and preserving a place online that’s actually for people. The internet used to be weird and human. We need to work together to keep at least one little corner of it that way.

Digg is young (lol). The team is small. Security isn’t Fort Knox yet. One invite in the wrong hands is all a motivated actor needs to quietly scrape every link, conversation, comment, and post from sensitive endpoints. This data is priceless to tech giants, and we need to preserve its integrity for the future of this place that we're building.

Once bots are in, they are almost impossible to root out. They can solve captchas, fabricate believable post histories, and blend in seamlessly.

## 🐑 Beyond Bans: A More “Digg” Solution

How do we encourage prudence without becoming oppressive gatekeepers?

Think of early private torrent trackers or early warez forums: if your invite misbehaved, you shared the ban. The whole chain would get wiped out. Effective, but harsh. We can do better. Let’s work together to build accountability that’s fun, social, and community-driven.

I call it Sheep Mode 🐑

## 🐑 Sheep Mode: Spam/Bot Prevention, the Digg Way

Instead of banning users who invite bots or trolls, we gently... but publicly... put the inviter in Sheep Mode for as long as the bot/troll lasted.

#### How It Works

-   You have a limited number of invites
-   If someone you invite gets flagged (via mod action or verified pattern detection) as a spammer or bot…
-   You enter Sheep Mode for the same number of days that account survived before getting caught

#### Example Sheep Mode Restrictions

-   New posts: ❌ Disabled
-   Voting: ✅ Allowed
-   Comments: ✅ Allowed (w/ restrictions?)
-   Profile/settings: 🔒 Locked
-   Website theme: 🔒 Forced "Sheep" default
-   Display name: Earned badges replaced with a 🐑 badge

#### 📊 The Weekly “Flock Report”

-   🗓️ This Week in the Pasture
-   🐑 New Sheep: 42
-   🎉 Escaped Sheep: 28
-   🧮 Total Sheep in Pasture: 137
-   🏆 Longest Sentence: @User (22 days left)
-   🧠 Top Shepherds: @User1, @User2 (5 clean invites each)

___

#### 💡 Why It Works

-   Incentivizes vetting: You’ll really think about who you’re vouching for
-   Builds a web of trust: A network of trusted shepherds emerges naturally
-   Stakes are social, not fatal: You can earn your way back. It’s playful, not punitive

___

### 🎯 Fun Add-ons

-   “Escape the Pasture” missions: Flag spam, help newcomers, write a reflection, etc.
-   “Clean Invite Streak” flair: Public proof of your spotless invite history
-   “Unvouching” option: Withdraw support for an invitee (with cooldown) to reduce your sentence if they go rogue

## 🧭 Choose Shepherding Over Gatekeeping

This isn't about closing Digg off. It's about building a human firewall, powered by trust, enforced by social accountability, and rooted in the weird, thoughtful humanity that made the internet worth loving in the first place. It's about remembering that we're not just users, we're the first line of defense in protecting the spirit of what we’re creating.

We have a rare chance to build something that lasts… something the future will need. This is our moment to outpace the bots and the tech giants we empowered.. not with scale, but with soul.

TL;DR - Invite carefully. Digg thoughtfully. Shepherd wisely.
