"""Scoring pipeline orchestrator.

This module implements the ScoringModule class which orchestrates the complete
scoring workflow from echo scores to final document score.

The pipeline chains WeightedScorer (pair-level scoring) and DocumentAggregator
(document-level aggregation) to provide a single entry point for scoring.

Tier 1 is a simple orchestrator with no additional logic beyond calling the
two component classes in sequence.

class ScoringModule:
    """Orchestrates weighted scoring and aggregation pipeline.

    The ScoringModule provides a unified interface for converting echo scores
    into a final document-level score. It chains two components:
    1. WeightedScorer: Converts each EchoScore -> pair score (float)
    2. DocumentAggregator: Converts List[pair scores] -> document score (float)

    Tier 1 Implementation:
    - Simple orchestration with no additional logic
    - Uses default configurations for WeightedScorer and DocumentAggregator
    - Delegates all scoring logic to component classes
    - Stateless operation

    This orchestrator pattern keeps the scoring pipeline modular and testable
    while providing a clean API for downstream consumers (SpecHODetector).

    Examples:
        >>> scorer = ScoringModule()
        >>> echo_scores = [
        ...     EchoScore(phonetic_score=0.8, structural_score=0.6,
        ...               semantic_score=0.7, combined_score=0.0),
        ...     EchoScore(phonetic_score=0.75, structural_score=0.65,
        ...               semantic_score=0.72, combined_score=0.0)
        ... ]
        >>> doc_score = scorer.score_document(echo_scores)
        >>> print(f"{doc_score:.3f}")
        0.707

        >>> # Empty input returns 0.0
        >>> doc_score = scorer.score_document([])
        >>> print(doc_score)
        0.0

        This is the main entry point for the scoring pipeline. It performs
        the complete scoring workflow:
        1. Convert each EchoScore to a pair score using WeightedScorer
        2. Aggregate all pair scores into document score using DocumentAggregator
        3. Return the final document score

        Algorithm (Tier 1):
            1. For each EchoScore, call weighted_scorer.calculate_pair_score()
            2. Collect all pair scores into a list
            3. Call aggregator.aggregate_scores() on the list
            4. Return the document score

        Args:
            echo_scores: List of EchoScore objects, one per clause pair.
                        Each contains phonetic, structural, and semantic scores.

        Returns:
            float: Document-level score in range [0,1]
                  - 0.0 indicates no echo signal (human/natural text)
                  - Higher values indicate stronger echo signal (watermarked)
                  - Returns 0.0 for empty input (delegated to aggregator)
