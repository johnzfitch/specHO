"""Core data models for SpecHO watermark detection pipeline.

This module defines the fundamental data structures used throughout the
SpecHO detection system. These dataclasses represent the transformation
of text through each stage of the five-component pipeline:

1. Token: Individual word with linguistic annotations (preprocessor output)
2. Clause: Boundary-detected clause segment (clause identifier output)
3. ClausePair: Two related clauses with extracted zones for comparison
4. EchoScore: Similarity scores from the three echo analyzers
5. DocumentAnalysis: Complete detection results for a document

Tier: 1 (MVP)
Task: 1.1
Dependencies: None (foundation task)

class Token:
    """Single token with linguistic annotations from preprocessing.

    Represents a word or punctuation mark enriched with linguistic features
    needed for watermark detection. The phonetic field enables phonetic echo
    analysis, POS tags enable structural analysis, and content-word status
    determines which tokens are extracted for zone comparison.

    Attributes:
        text: The raw word or punctuation string
        pos_tag: Part-of-speech tag (e.g., 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'ADJ')

    Represents a syntactic unit containing a subject and predicate, identified
    through dependency parsing. Clauses are the fundamental units of analysis
    for the Echo Rule watermark, as echoing patterns manifest at clause
    boundaries rather than arbitrary word positions.

    Attributes:

    aggregation of the three dimensions.

    All scores are normalized to the range [0.0, 1.0] where:
    - 0.0 indicates no similarity
